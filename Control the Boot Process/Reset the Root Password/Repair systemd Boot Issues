Proactively debug boot issues

	Before rebooting run:
		systemctl enable debug-shell.service
		
	Early in the boot process, the system will automatically log in as root so you can debug
	
	IMPORTANT: this is clarly risky.
	
Activate debug shell during boot
	On the line starting with linux, press e to append the following param:
		system.debug-shell
	Press ctrl+x to boot into the debug shell
	
Jobs: sometimes they stop your system from booting

	If a job cannot start (that is part of the boot process), this will delay or stop subsequent jobs used in the boot process.
	
	Admins can check the status of jobs:
		systemctl list-jobs
		
	Running jobs must complete before the waiting jobs can start running
