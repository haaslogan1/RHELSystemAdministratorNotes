I can't even use the rescue target!
Whether RHEL was installed from an image from the cloud or a DVD, the steps to make changes (when even the root user cannot be used via the rescue target) will be these:
	
	1. Reboot the system.
	2. Interrupt the boot-loader countdown by pressing any key except Enter.
	3. Press e to edit the selected entry.
	4. Move the cursor to the kernel command line (the line that starts with linux).
	5. Append rd.break. With that option, the system breaks just before the system hands control from the initramfs image to the actual system.
	6. Press Ctrl+x to boot with the changes.
	7. Press Enter to perform maintenance when prompted.


Actually Change the root user's password

	1. Remount /sysroot as rw
	
		mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
	
	2. Make /sysroot the root of the FS
	
		chroot /sysroot
		
	3. Change the root user's password
	
		passwd root
		
	4. All unlabeled files need to be re-labeled!

		touch /.autorelabel
		
	5. Exit twice!

		exit
		exit
		
		First, for the chroot jail
		Second, for the initramfs debug shell
