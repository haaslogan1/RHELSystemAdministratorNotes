How do I get started with tuned?

	The package is ready to be installed in even the most minimal RHEL installations
	
	Just do the following
	
		dnf install tuned
		
		systemctl enable --now tuned
		
Tell me about tuned profiles

	They are all essentially somewhere on the long spectrum between performance and power-saving
	
	For my test systems, it is probably best to tune the system for power ssaving:
		tudned profile = powersave
		
Tuned profile configuration

	All profile configuration files are located here:
		/etc/tuned/
		/usr/lib/tuned/
		
		If two profiles exists with the same name, the one in /etc/tuned takes precedence.
		
	[main]
		include sets the tuned profile
		
	[sysctl]
		sets those kernel params we were talking about.
