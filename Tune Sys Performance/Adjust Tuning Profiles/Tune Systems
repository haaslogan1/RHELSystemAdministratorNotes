Is there a daemon to help with tuning?

	Of course there is!
	
	The tund daemon uses tuning profiles that reflect use cases (workload requirements)
	
How do I set up static tuning?

	You configure kernel params in profiles that the tuned daemon applies at runtime
	
	Important: static tuning sets kernel params based only on expectations. There are not runtime changes if those kernel params aren't equipped to handle reality.
	
How is Dynamic Tuning Different?

	Dynamic Tuning starts with the settings in your tuning profile, but constant adjusts to meet the current workload.
	
How does dynamic tuning work?

	You need to adjust the monitor (tuning modules) and tuning plug-ins. The tuned daemon uses them to monitor and adjusts params as needed.
	
	
	Monitor plug-ins analyze the entire system. Tuning plug-ins use the analytics from the monitor plug-ins for dynamic tuning of subsystems.
		Monitor plug-ins -> system resource data -> Tuning plug-ins -> improved sys efficiency
	
	Monitor plug-ins
		1. disk
			i. Monitors disk load based on # of I/O operations for each disk device
		2. net
			i. Monitors # of transferred packets per network card
		3. load
			i. Monitors CPU load per CPU
	
	Tuning plug-ins
		1. disk
			i. sets disk params.
				1) Examples
					a) disk scheduler
					b) spin-down timeout
					c) advanced power management
		2. net
			i. configures:
				1) interface speed
				2) WoL (wake-on-LAN) functionality
		3. cpu
			i. sets CPU params
				1) Example
					a) CPU governor of latency

Is Dynamic Tuning enabled by default?

	No.
	
How do I enable dynamic tuning?

	Enable it in this file: /etc/tuned/tuned-main.conf
	
	Params to look for:
		dynamic_tuning
			1 =  enabled
			0 = not enabled
			
		update_interval
			time (in seconds) between the tuned daemon monitoring and tuning the system
