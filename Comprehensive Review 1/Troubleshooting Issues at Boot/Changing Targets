	Here's how:
		1. Boot the system.
		2. Interrupt the boot loader menu countdown by pressing any key except Enter.
		3. Move the cursor to the kernel entry to start.
		4. Press e to edit the current entry.
		5. Move the cursor to the line that starts with linux which is the kernel command line.
		6. Append systemd.unit=target.target, for example, systemd.unit=emergency.target.
		7. Press Ctrl+x to boot with these changes.
