1. Check to ensure that the root filesystem is mounted with rw access
	
	Check by running mount
	
	If it only has ro access, run:
		mount -o remount,rw /
		
2. Try to mount all file systems (it will display an error for the problematics FSs)

	mount --all
	
3. After correcting the issue, inform the systemd daemon to reload the /etc/fstab file:

	systemctl daemon-reload
	mount --all
	
	
4. If this works, continue with the reboot:

	systemctl reboot
