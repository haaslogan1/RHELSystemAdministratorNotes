netfilter framework

	The kernel provides the netfilter framework for:
		packet filtering
		network address traslation
		port translation
		
	The netfilter framework uses hooks which:
		intercept event (like a packet entering an interface)
		then, run other related routines (like a firewall rule)
		
		kind of like a TAI!
		
nftables framework

	nftables packet classification framework 
	
firewalld

	The firewalld service simplifies networking by classifying network traffic into zones
	
		Each zone has a list or ports and services that are open or closed (like the sshd service on port 22)
		
	Packet is sent to your network
		The firewalld service checks whether there is a zone for the source address of the packet
			Zone exists -> those rules apply
			No zone exists -> follow rules of the incoming network interface
			Network interface is not associated with a zone -> use the default zone rules
				The default zone is typically set to the public zone
				Later, firewalld maps the lo loopback interface to the trusted zone
