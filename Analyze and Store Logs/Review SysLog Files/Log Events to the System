rsyslog service: handling messages
	message's facility (origin) and priority determine how rsys routes the message
	
	The routing configuration can be modified via:
		/etc/rsyslog.conf
		/etc/rsyslog.d/*.conf
		
		Example: etc/rsyslog.d/auth.conf will rout messages from the authpriv facility to the /var/log/secure file:
		
			authpriv.*                /var/log/secure
			
	One message can be routed to multiple logs, if the rule matches multiple logs. Alternaticely, the none keywork can route no messages for the indicated facility to the given log file
	
	Example: Everybody gets emergency messages. /etc/rsyslog.d/emergency.conf
	
		.emerg                           :omusrmsg:
		

Log File Rotation

	The logrotate command allows you to manually rotate log files.
	
	Usually, log files rote every few weeks depnding on the configuration used by the scheduled job that runs the logrotate command daily.
