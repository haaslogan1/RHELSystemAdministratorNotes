Easiest Method to Persist Journal

	Change the location of the journal to a persistent location (rather than the /run/log directory) bu modifying the value in /etc/systemd/journald.conf)
	
		Storage parameter is what you would change.
		Values
			ยง Persistent - store journal in /var/log/journal directory
			ยง volatile - store in /run/log/journal
			ยง auto (default) - only store in /var/log/journal directory if the file already exists
			ยง none - drop all logs after passing to rsyslog
		
		
Obvious Persistent Storage Drawback

	There are a lot of messages which can take up space!

	By default, the journal has a built-in rotation mechanism that triggers monthly. Plus, the system does not allow journals to be larger than 10% of the file system or leaving <15% free
	
		Modifiable in /etc/systemd/journald.conf
		
Persistent System Journals

Configure by only creating /var/log/journal directory and restarting the systemd-journald service

	Then, the journals will be created as long hex directories that you can read with journalctl
	
	Example: Distinguish boots
	
		journalctl --list-boots
		
		## Choose boot 2
		
		journalctl -b 2
