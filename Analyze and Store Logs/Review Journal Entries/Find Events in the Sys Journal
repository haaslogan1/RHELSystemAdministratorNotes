Journal
	structured, indexed binary file that the systemd-journald service writes logging data into
	
	The journal tells what we see in the /var/log/* logs + facility + priority
	
	Note: the journal is stored in the /run/log directory which is lost each time the system is shut down. If needed, change the location to a persistent directory.
	
journalctl

	journalctl displays all log messages (for the root user)
	
	Important: limit journal searches to filter for relevant output.
	
	Example: List journal entries with the err priority or higher.
		journalctl -p err
		
	Example: List journal entries for the sshd service
		journalctl -u sshd.service
		
	Example: :List journal entry from an issue that occurred on November 5, 2023 at 10 PM
		journalctl --since "2023-11-05 21:59" --until "2023-11-05 22:01"
		
	Example: Use fields to filter for specific events
journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNTI=sshd.service _PID=x
