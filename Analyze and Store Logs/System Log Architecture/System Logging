The systemd-journald and rsyslog services handle the syslog-based messaged in RHEL 9.

systemd-journald is the key component of RHEL Logging. It handles:
	• System Kernel
	• Early portions of booting the OS
	• STDOUT and STDERR from daemons

rsyslog service
	rsyslog service sorts and organizes messages into log files in the /var/log directory
	
	The /var/log directory contains log files from most services on the system.
	
		/var/log/messages - most syslog messages. Exceptions include: authentication, email processing, scheduled job execution, purely debugging messages
		
		/var/log/secure - syslog messages about security and authn event
		
		/var/log/maillog - syslog messages about the mail server
		
		/var/log/cron - syslog message about scheduled job execution
		
		/var/log/boot.log - nonsyslog console messages about startup
