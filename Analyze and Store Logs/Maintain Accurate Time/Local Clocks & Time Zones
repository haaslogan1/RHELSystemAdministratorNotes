How do Linux machines keep the correct time?

	NTP! Network Time Protocol. There are different public NTP services that a machine may use.
	
		You can disable NTP synchronization with:
			timedatectl set-ntp false
	
	Alternativelty, sync with a hardware clock.
	
	
	
Find the time thatyour machine thinks is accurate
	timedatectl  shows what you'll need to check.
