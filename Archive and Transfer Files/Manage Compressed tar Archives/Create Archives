Different types of Archives
	Archives are a single fle that contain multiple files. They can contain:
		1. Regular files
		2. Device files
	
	When an archive has a regular file, it is basically the same as a zip file.
	
Archive File Use Cases
	1. Create a backup
	2. Share files within a network when rsync may be too complicated
	3. Compression is not always required for an archive to be an archive!

tar: probably the best
	tar is the common archive tool. Advantage:
		It contains file metadata + index to extract specific files rather than extracting all files (if desired)
		
		List files within, without extracting
		
		Extracts files from compressed on uncompressed archives
		
	tar Actions
		--create
		--list
		--extract
		
		Kind of obvious what those actions do.
		
	Algorithms
	
		--auto-compress: use the archive's suffix to determine the best alg to use
		--gzip
		--bzip2
		--xz
		
	Permission Requirements
	
		Must be able to read a file to make an archive with it via tar
		
	Example: create a tar file with some logs
		cd /var/logs/secure
		tar -cf log1 log2 log3
		
	Example: take out the ablsolute path!!
		tar -cf /root/etc-backup.tar /etc
		tar: removing leading '/' from member names
		
	Example: List archive contents
		tar -tf mytar.tar
