Do I need to specify an alg?
	Again (just like when listing archive contents), no need to specify the alg since it is stored in the archive's header.
	
	If you specify an incorrect alg, tar will laugh, send an error, and exist with exit code 1. Like this: Example
		tar -xzf /root/etcbackup.tar.xz
		gzip: stdin: not in gzip format
tar: Child returned status 1
tar: Error is not recoverable: exiting now

Why would you want to uncompress an archive but not extract the files?
	
	Not sure.
	
	Regardless, you can with the following alg-specific commands:
		gunzip
		bunzip2
		unxz

Verify size of uncompressed files before uncompressing
	The gzip -l and xz -l can tell you the compressed v. uncompressed sizes
