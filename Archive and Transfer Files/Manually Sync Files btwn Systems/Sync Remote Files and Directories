rsync: remote Sync
	Efficiently syncs file systems by only replacing the differences between files
	
		This is very advantageous when syncing large file systems
		
	IMPORTANT: run with the dry run option first (-r) to ensure no critical files are replaced.
	
WebSphere Example - Horrible idea: normally, you can't sync the properties directory. Now, you can:

	rsync uid@host:/opt/IBM/WebSphere905/AppServer/profiles/DMGR/properties/ /opt/IBM/WebSphere905/AppServer/profiles/custom01/properties/
