sftp: interactive Version of scp

	sftp is basically OpenSSH's implementation of an interactive data transfer tool
	
	sftp - secure file transfer protocol
	
		just a guess, but seems like what it does
		
	Just like SSHing into a remote host! 
	
Browsing through a remote host with sftp

	cd, mkdir, ls, pwd, â€¦ are all the same as if you used SSH to access the remote host
	
		Throw an 'l' in front to specify localhost
		Example
			lpwd
			
	
	New options
		put - put a file from your localhost on the remote host
		
		get - get a file from the remote host to the local host
