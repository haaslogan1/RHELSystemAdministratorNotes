All container data is lost when removing a container(ephemeral nature). How can I persist this data?
	
	With the -v (or --volume) option when running the container.
	
File Permissions
	
	Example: mariaDB
		mariaDB requires that the mysql uid and gid owns this directory: /usr/lib/mysql
		
		In this case, root is not the uid or gid. So, make sure the mounted FS has that UID and GID owning that directory.
		
Checking file permission

	podman unshare /path/to/file
	
	The output will show:
		first line: root user of container (0) maps to this UID and GUID on the local machine
		second line: the container user owning the file  (1) maps to this UID and GUID on the local machine
		
Check the db01 container for the UID and GID of the mysql user

	podman exec db01 sh -c 'grep mysql /etc/passwd'
	
		-> find that uid 27 is the mysql user
	
Make a directory to mount in the container (owned by the mysql user)
	
	mkdir ~/db_data
	podman unshare chown 27:27 ~/db_data
	
Correct file perms are set. So, run the container with '-v' to mount a FS
	podman run -d --name db01 \
	-e MYSQLUSER = \
	...\
	-v ~/db_data:/var/lib/mysql:Z\
	registry.lab.example.com/rhel8/mariadb-105
	
	
		This only works because ':Z' automatically sets the container_file_t context for the container.
