Why would a container need a SELinux context?
	If you mount a directory on the container from the local machine, the container needs an SELinux context just like other processes.
	
	In that case, it needs:
		container_file_t
		
	You can do this while mounting via:
		podman run --volume /path/to/file:/container/path:Z
