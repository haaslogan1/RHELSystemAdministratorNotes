Default
	
	By default, containers are not DNS-enabled.
	
Create a DNS-enabled Network

	podman network create --gateway <ip> --subnet <ip>/<length> db_net
	
Verify the newly created DNS-enabled Network 'db_net'

	podman network inspect db_net

Run a container on the network

	podman run ... --network db_net
	
Testing with ping and ip commands
	
	Containers have minimal packages. So, they probably don't have these commands. Install like this:
		podman exec containerId sh -c 'dnf install -y iputils iproute'
		
	Then, of course, test:
		podman exec containerID sh -c 'ping c3 containerName'
		
	Use 'ip a' to test that the IP address was set correctly:
		podman exec containerID sh -c 'ip a'
