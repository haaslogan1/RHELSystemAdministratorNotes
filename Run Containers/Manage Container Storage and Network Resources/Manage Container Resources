Scalability Options
	• Enterprise solution that needs to scale
		○  -> kubernetes
	• small deployments on a single container host w/ no need to scale
		○ -> just mount a directory within the container (think about a web server that will store content in /var/www/html/)

Network communication with a container
	Port mapping is required.
	
Next few sections

	Suppose you need to:
		○ create a containerized db based on MariaDB
		○ configure port mapping and host firewall to allow traffic on 3306/tcp
		○ configure the db for persistent storage with the correct selinux context
		○ add appropriate network config so client01 host can reach the db via DNS
