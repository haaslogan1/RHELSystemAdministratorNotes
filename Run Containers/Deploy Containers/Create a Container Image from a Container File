Example Container File (instructions to build a container image)

	
	FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
	RUN dnf install -y python36
	CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep infinity"]

What does the above container file instruct?

	base image: registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
	
	Then, it will install the python36 package and sleep forever to avoid the container terminating after completing the three instructions.
	
	Why?
		developers can run python in this container


Build the container image

	podman build -t NAME:TAG DIR
	
		NAME: name for the new image
		TAG: tag for the image
			default is latest
		DIR: path to the directory storing the container file
		
	Example
		Build the container container image from the directory storing the container file
			podman build -t python36:1.0 .
		Output:
			STEP 1/3: FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest
	`		STEP 2/3: RUN dnf install -y python36
			...output omitted...STEP 3/3: CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep infinity"]
			COMMIT python36:1.0
			
Check that the image was built successfully

	podman images
	
Inspect the newly built image

	podman inspect
