Create & Start a Container at once (no container file needed)
	
	Simply use the podman run command. This will pull the image from the repo and run it.
	
	Example: almost exactly what our container file did
	
		podman run -d --name python38 \
		registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/python-38 \
		sleep infinity
		
		-d -> detached mode to run in the background
