Container isolation

	Containers have their own file sys, networking, and processes. Completely seperate from the rest of the sys.

How do we know containers actually isolate the app's env from the rest of the system (minus the kernel)?

	Just look at the stunning difference between:
		1. Processes running on the OS
			i. ps -ax
		2. Processes running in a container
			i. podman exec containerID ps -ax
			
Importance of 'sh -c' when running podman exec
	sh -c ensures that the complete command is run in the container avoiding the possibility of Podman determining a speachial char is for the Podman command.
	
		Example: this command would not run correctly without 'sh -c'
			podman exec containerID sh -c 'ps -ax > /tmp/mylog'
