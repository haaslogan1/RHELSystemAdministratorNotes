Important: files that you create on the local file system will not be accessible within the container (and vice versa).

Give me an example showing how this is useful.
	
	Your sys can run python 3.8 while testing your app on a container in python 3.7

Copy files from your local FS to your container

	podman cp /tmp/myfile containerName:/tmp/myfile
