	1. Check which registries podman is configured for
	
		podman info
		
	2. Search your configured registries for the image you need (python 3.8, in this example)
	
		podman search python-38
		
	3. Inspect & compare an image with the others across all configured regisitries
	
		skopeo search docker://registry.com/python-38
		
		Of course, that is not a real image URL, just an ex.
		
	4. Pull the image that best matches your needs
	
		podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/python-38
		
	5. Check that the image was pulled successfully
	
		podman images
