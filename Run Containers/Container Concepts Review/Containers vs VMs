Similarities
	• They both isolate app runtime resources from the hypervisor or OS
	
VMs
	• Multiple OSs can run on one hardware machine
	• hypervisor to divide hardware into multiple virtual hardware systems (VMs)
	• requires a complete OS to support an app

Containers
	• Runs directly on the host OS
	• Shares resources with all other containers on the sys
	• Shares only the host's kernel
		○ app process is completely isolated from the rest of the sys
	• Doesn't require nearly as many resources as a VM
		○ quick startup! :)
	• Include all dependenices
		○ sys, app, programming, and config dependencies
