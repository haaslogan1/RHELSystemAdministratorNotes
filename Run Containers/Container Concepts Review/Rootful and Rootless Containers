What is the difference?
	
	If you run a container as a privileged user, it is rootful.
	
	If you run a container as a non-privileged regular user, it is rootless.
	
Rootless containers

	The container inherits the prviliges of the user who ran the container. 
		So, a rootless container will not have access to system files and cannot run on ports below 1024.
		
Best practice: don't run containers as root. This will only make life easier if a malicious user exploits a vulnerability.
