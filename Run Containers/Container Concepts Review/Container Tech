Problem with running apps on a VM

	Issue #1: VMs and their OS already contain lots of software + now add everything that your app requires
	
	Issue #2: Application and OS dependency versions may vary. Especially if you have multiple apps running on a VM that require different versions of the same software for their dependenices.
	
Resolution: container
	
	A container is 1+ prcoesses that are isolated from the rest of the VM
	
Benefit of containerization

	It is an easy way to package your software and ensure the software has the dependencies it needs.
	
	Plus, containerization can simplify deployment and config changes.
	
RHEL Implementation

	1. Control groups (cgroups) for resource management
	2. Namespaces for process isolation
	3. SELinux and Seccomp (secure computing mode) to enforce security boundaries
