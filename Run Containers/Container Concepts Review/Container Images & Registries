Image Registries & Security

	It is important to:
		1. Establish trust of any image that you want to run as a container
		2. Trust the registry that you pull that image from
			i. Review how the registry (ex. DockerHub) determines the image is secure.
Login to access a Registry

	Example using podman:
		podman login myregistry.example.com
