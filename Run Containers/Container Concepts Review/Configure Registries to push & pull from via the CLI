root user / default  non-priviliged user

	The config specified in /etc/containers/registires.conf will be used
	
Override the registries.conf config

	~/.config/containers directory
	
What can I specify in these config files?

	Important things like:
		unqualified search registries list
			This is a list of registries to search in if the FQDN is not specified
		the registries in that list
			location (hostname)
			insecure - HTTPS or HTTP
			blocked - true or false
