Portability
	Containers can be saved at any time and moved between systems. This makes moving from dev to production much easier.
	
Ephemeral (aka temporary in my vocab)
	Containers will stop when they are not used and re-spawn (as a new container process) when they are needed

Architecture Best Practice

	Limit only one service per container. So, configuration changes only have to be implied for one service at a time.
	
		For example, one container for a web server and another container for a DB that the web server might need
