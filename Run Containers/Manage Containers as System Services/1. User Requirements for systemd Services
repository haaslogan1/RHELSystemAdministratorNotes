Two types of services

	1. System services start at system boot and stop at shutdown
	2. Regular services can be ran via systemctl. They start when you tell them to (systemctl). Then, they start and stop depending on activity (stopping when inactive and re-starting when invoked)

User Creation

	When you create a user (useradd), the system reserves a range of IDs for the user in the /etc/subuid file.
	
		If you use the --system option, this will not happen bceause it is a sys account.
		
		Hence, system accounts cannot run rootless containers.
		
Important: podman reduires a full session. You cannot run podman via a 'su' or 'sudo' session.
