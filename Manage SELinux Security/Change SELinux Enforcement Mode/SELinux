Why SELinux?

	The prupose of SELink is to set policies on the usage of files. Permissions lready handles RWX
	
		Best part: if you don't set up a minimal, you are even more secure because there are very few actions that a malicious user could possibly execute
		
		confined = policy set
		unconfined = no policy set
		
	owner, group, and world permissions (AKA Discretionary Access Control - DAC) are not enough as they can be easily changed
	
	SELinux adds MAC (Mandatory Access Control) which all users cannot bypass
		
What are the SELinux modes?

	1. Enforcing
		a. Enforces loaded policies. Default.
	2. Permissive
		a. Only logs access violations. 
		b. Helpful for testing and troubleshooting apps and policy rules
	3. Disabled
		a. strongly discouraged!
		b. Not even possible in the future: RHEL 9


SELinux Protection

	SELinux secures every file, port, process, or directory by assigning an SELinuc context to each.
	
		The context matches the policy rule. By defauly, no access! A policy rule is needed to grant access.
		
Please show me an example label in a SELinux policy file.

	user:role:type:Level file
	
		wasadmin:object_r:httpd_sys_content_t:s0/ar/www/html/file2
