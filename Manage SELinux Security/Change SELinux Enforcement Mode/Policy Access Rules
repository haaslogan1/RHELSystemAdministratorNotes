Tell me about Policy Rules for a web server


	There are a few context types (notice every tpe ends in '_t') for a web server:
		the web server process: httpd_t
		files in the var/www/html directory: httpd_sys_content_t
		
In that case, how does the web server process access the necesssary /var/www/html files?

	Good question! ;) 
	
	The httpd_t web server process has a pre-defined policy rule allowing the Apache server httpd process to access the httpd_sys_content_t type context files
	
How do I check SELinux contexts for files, processes, etc?

	Many commands use the -Z option
	
	Example: check 'label' (aka context) for processes on my machine:
		[logan@logan ~]$ ps axZ
		LABEL                               PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
		
	Example: Check context for the var directory
	
		[logan@logan /]$ ls -Z /var
