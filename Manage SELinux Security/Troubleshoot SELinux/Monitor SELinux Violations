Is there a package I can install to help troubleshoot SELinux issues?

	of course!
	
	The settroubeshoot-server package!
	
What happens when SELinux denies an action?

	Well, the user (who might be malicious) cannot perform that action at the moment.
	
	Then, the AVC (access vector cache) logs a message in the /var/log/audit/audit.log file.
	
	The SELinux troubleshooting service (settroubleshoot-server package) sends a summary to the /var/log/messages file
	
What are some best practices when reviewing SELinux events?

	(1) Check the event's UUID in the /var/log/messages log file
	
	(2) Run sealert -l UUID to comprehensive details
	
How do I see all existing events?

	Run:
		 sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log
	
What if I don't want to use the CLI?

	Yikes, you should get used to the CLI.
	
	Luckily, the web console has a SELinux tab which provides an easy way to enable SELinux and resolve SELinux access control errors.
	
General Troubleshooting Flow

	Permission not granted to execute an action 
	
	->
	
	View /var/log/messages to find the most recent AVC message (searching for sealert)
	
	-> 
	
	Extract the UUID from the messages log
	
	->
	
	Run:
		sealert -l UUID
		ausearch -m AVC -ts today
		
	-> 
	
	Find the source process, necessary context, and target object (file)
	
		You can find necessary context by looking at the file:
			ls -Z file
	
	->
	
	ONLY IF APPLICABLE:
		Add the SELinux permission via:
			semanage fcontext -a -t TYPE FILE
			semanage fcontext -a -t TYPE 'DIRECTORY(/.*)?'
