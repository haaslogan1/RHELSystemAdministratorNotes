Where are SELinux contexts stored and modified?

	/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files
	
	Example: what's in the directory?
	
		[logan@logan ~]$ ls -ltr /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/
		total x
		â€¦.
		
What about when you create a new file or directory?

	Context inheritance!
	
	If a file does not have a specific policy file, it inherits its parents.
	
How about when I copy a file to a new location?

	By default, the file inherits its parent's context.
	
	However, this can be avoided with the --preserve=context option
	
	What if I move a file instead of copying a file?
	
		All good! SELinux preserves the context by default :)
