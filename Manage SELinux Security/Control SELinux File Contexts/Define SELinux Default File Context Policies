How do I know what policy sets apply to my files?

	Run:
		semanage fcontext -l
		
	Be prepared for regex in the result.
	
	Keep in mind that this means the context applies to the directory and all files/directories in that directory:
	
		(/.*)?
		
	The most specific context applies. Just like file permissions!
	
How do I add a file context policy?

	semanage fcontext --add
	
	Example 
		[root@host ~]# semanage fcontext --add -t httpd_sys_content_t '/virtual(/.*)?'
		
	Example: let the people access the web server!
		semanage fcontext --add -t httpd_sys_content_t'/var/www/html(/.*)?'
	
How do I recmove a file context polixy?

	semanage fcontext --delete
	
Should've mentioned this earlier. Do I need to install anything to use semanage and restorecon?

	Yea. Youre're going to need to install:
		policycoreutils
		policycoreutils-python-utils
