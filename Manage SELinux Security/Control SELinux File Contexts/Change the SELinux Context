How do I change the SELinux context of a file?

	2 steps:
	
		1. Create a file context with the following command:
			i. semanage fcontext
		2. Set the context for the file
			i. restorecon
	
Is there a one-step way to change the context?
	
	chcon allows you to quickly modify the SELinux context. However, the context (set by chcon) will not survive running restorecon
