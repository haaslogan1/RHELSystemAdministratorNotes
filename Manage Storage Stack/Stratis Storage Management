What is Stratis?

	Local storage Management tool that configures initial storage, changes a storageconfig, and uses advanced storage features.
	
	It is currently a "Tech Preview" but it will be fully supported in later versions of RHEL 9.
	
What is the advantage of Stratis?

	Stratis dynamically allocates storage by the thin provisioning concept. So, a file system may appear to have 1 TiB of storage, but stratis will only allocated some amount (say 100 GiB) from the pool until more is needed.
	
How many file systems can a Stratis pool provide physical storage to?

	Up to 2^24 file systems!
