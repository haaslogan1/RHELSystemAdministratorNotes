How do I build LVM storage?

	We just went over that in the last pageâ€¦
			1. Determine devices for physical volume
			2. Initialize the devices as LVM physical volumes
			3. Create volume group from the physical volumes
			4. Create logical volumes from space in the volume group
			5. Format the logical volume as needed (which I learned how to do in the 'Manage Basic Storage' section)

Step 1: Prepare Physical Devices

	This is simply just partitioning on a physical device (setting the physical device to the Linux LVM partition type):
	
		parted /dev/my_physical_device mklabel gpt mkpart primary 0B 1B
		
		parted /dev/my_physical_device mkpart primary 1B 2B
		
		parted  /dev/my_physical_device set 1 lvm on
		parted  /dev/my_physical_device set 2 lvm on
		
		udevadm settle
		
Step 2: Create Physical Volumes

	Label the physical partition as an LVM physical volume.
	
	Example: Label two devices (/dev/device1 and /dev/device2) as PVs ready for creating VGs
	
		pvcreate /dev/device1 /dev/device2
		
Step 3: Create Volume Group

	Build 1+ PVs into a VG
	
	Example: Create the myVG using the physical volumes created in the last example.
	
		vgcreate myVG /dev/device1 /dev/device2
		
Step 4: Create Logical Volume

	Create a LV from available PEs in a VG
	
	Example: Use the VG from step 3 to create a LV with name myLV, a size of 2 bytes
		lvcreate -n myLV -L 2B myVG
		

Step 5: Add FS to the logical volume

	mkfs -t xfs /dev/myVG/mlLV

Step 6: Verify Size (after mounting the FS)

	df -f /mountpoint
	
	OR 
	
	lsblk --fs
