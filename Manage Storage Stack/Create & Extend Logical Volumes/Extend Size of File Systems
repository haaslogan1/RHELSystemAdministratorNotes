Extend XFS File System

	Grow a mounted file system:
	
		xfs_growfs /my/mount_point
		
Extend EXT4 File System

	Just a different command from XFS:
		
		resize2fs /dev/myDevice/myLV
		
	NOTE: EXT4 growth passes a LV as the param while XFS uses the mount point.
	
Differences: XFS v. EXT4 Growth

		1. XFS will only grow, but you can shrink an ext4 file system
		2. XFS only supports an online resize, ext4 can be offline
		3. Params passed to the commands
