Are there any prereqs to extending a LV?

	Yes. If there is not space, you need to extend the PV or VG first.
	
How do I Extend VG size?

	(1) Add more size by creating a new PV. Documented in 'Build LVM Storage'
	
		Say that I created a third partition on device /dev/vdb
		
	(2) Add the new PV to the VG 'myVG'
	
		vgextend myVG /dev/vdb3
		
How do I extend Logical Volume Size?

	NOTE: This is a signfiicant benefit of LVs. You can extend storage without downtime.
	
	We can extend the LV by adding from a VG.
	
	Example

		First, check that we have space in the VG:
			
			vgdisplay
			
		Then, use lvextend to extend the LV by 500 MB:
		
			lvextend -L +500M /dev/myDevice/myLV
			
		NOTE: Without the '+', this will set the size of the LV to only 500M.
