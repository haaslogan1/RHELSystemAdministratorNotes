LVM = Logical Volume Manager

Key Terms

	Physical Devices
		Disk partitions, whole disks, RAID arrays, SAN disks
		
		Must:
			1.  be initialized as an LVM physical volume 
			2. use entire physical device
		
	Physical Volumes (PVs)
		Basically the physical device.
		
		LVM makes physical extents (PEs) to segment the PV into the smallest chunk unit
		
	Volume Groups (VGs)
		Storage pool consisting of PVs. Each PV must be part of only one VG.
		
	Logical Volumes (LVs)
		Storage devices for users, apps, and OSs. They are made of free LEs.
			An LE (logical extent) is an abstraction of a PE. By default, 1 PE = 1 LE
