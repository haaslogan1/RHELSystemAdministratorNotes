What do I need to do before creating LVM storage?

	Must build structures in a logical workflow.
	
How do I build structures in a logical workflow?

	1. Determine devices for physical volume
	2. Initialize the devices as LVM physical volumes
	3. Create volume group from the physical volumes
	4. Create logical volumes from space in the volume group
	5. Format the logical volume as needed (which I learned how to do in the 'Manage Basic Storage' section)
