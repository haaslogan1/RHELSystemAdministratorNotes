First: Download the image you need from the Customer Portal

	There are a few options:
		1. Binary image file (ISO 9660 format) 
			This contains all the repos needed for installation
			
		2. boot ISO image (smaller than (1))
			You're going to need internet connection to get some package repos through the install process..
			
		3. QCOW2 image
			Ready to go! Best for cloud/enterprise envs.
			
		4. Source code
			Difficult install, but good for development

Second (for options (1) and (2) above):

	Simply use the GUI to select config preferences then begin the installation... RHEL handles the rest.

Want to save your current sys for future use?

	Make an image with the composer-cli command!
