(1) Create Kickstart file

	Two options:
			1. Write it in a text editor as shown before
			
				Use ksvalidator to validate the file
				
				Start with samples from:
					/root/anaconda-ks.cfg
				
			2. Use a kickstart generator

(2) Validate the Kickstart file

	ksvalidator

(3) Publish the file to anaconda

	You need to make it available. Think:
		Accessible network server
		USB disk or CD-ROM
		local hard disk
		
	Usually, it is available via the web, FTP, or NFS server
	
(3) Boot Anaconda pointing to the Kickstart file

	Add inst.ks parameter to the install kernel
