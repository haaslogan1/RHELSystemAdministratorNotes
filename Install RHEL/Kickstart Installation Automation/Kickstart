Why Kickstart?
	You can automate the installation process! Think time-consuming activities like partitioning a disk.
	
	Especially helpful when there are multiple upcoming installations.
	
How are kickstart scripts formatted?

	%pre and %post
		% denotes the beginning of a section
		&end denotes the end of a section
		
		pre is before disk partitioning
			IMPORTANT: extremely difficult to troubleshoot. It is best not to do this one.
		post is after the initial installation
