Why automounter?

	Automounter is a service (autofs) that solves this issue:
		Unprivileged users cannot run mount. If their block devices (like a removable disk drive) is not automatically mounted, they can't access it.
		
	Automounter (autofs) will automatically mount devices until they are not being actively used.
	
How is autofs configured?

	Automounter is configured similar to /etc/fstab
	
	However, file systems become accessible when a user wants to reach them (on-demand) rather than from boot.
	
Benefit of automount
	1. Both unmounted and mounted but inactive file systems use almost no resources
	2. Less likely to face an unexpected file corruption because the mount config is being refreshed whenever users stop and start using the FS
		a. Persistently mounted file systems face issues since it may be months between reboots
	3. Avoids redundant NFS servers and paths
	
Direct and Indirect Mounting

	Direct:
		All mounting that we've worked on up until this point. Mount a specific directory.
		
	Indirect:
		Mount point set when the demand is made.
