Same troubleshooting process as a normal file system. If umount fails, the most likely issue is that a file is open for some reason (maybe a user or application is causing it).

First Step
	Run:
		lsof /mountpoint
		
	This will tell us which files are open for the mounted file system.
	
In a dire situation
	You can run umount -f ... to force the issue.
