How do I manually mount an exported NFS directory?

	1. Make the mount point
		
		mkdir /mountpoint
		
	2. Simply, mount what you need!
		
		mount -o rw,sync server_name:/exported_dir /mountpoint
		
			Adding the -o flag to specify read/write access with all changes synced to the NFS server's copy of the directory

Will a manual mount persist through a reboot?

	No.
