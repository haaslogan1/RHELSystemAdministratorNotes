Why?
	It may be slightly easier than installing autofs, if you only want to auto-mount one directory (fully qualified path)
	
How?
	(1) Define the mount in /etc/fstab
	
		For example, mount a device at this location: /mntpoint/logan
	
	(2) Run:
	
		systemctl daemon-reload
	
		systemctl start mntpoint-logan.automount
