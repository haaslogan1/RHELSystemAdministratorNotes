How do I create swap space?

	2 steps:
	
		1) Create a partition with file system type linux-swap
		2) Place a swap signature on the device
	
How do I apply a swap signature to the block device?

	Use the mkswap [block device] command
	
	This creates a single block of data at the beginning and leaves the rest so the kernel can use it for storing memory pages.
