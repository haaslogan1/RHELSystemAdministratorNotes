How do I activate swap space persistently?

	Again, do it in the /etc/fstab file!

	UUID=â€¦ swap swap defaults 0 0
	
	Parameters
		We see swap instead of the mount point because swap devices are not accessible through the directory structure
		
		Also, file system type = swap in this case
		
Don't forget to reload daemons!
