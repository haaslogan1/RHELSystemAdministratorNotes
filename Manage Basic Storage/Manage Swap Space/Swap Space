Virtual memory = swap space + RAM

How is memory accessed?

	When a page of memory is inactive in the RAM, the kernel pushes it to the swap space.
	
	When a page of memory is needed (and does not exist in the RAM), the kernel moves it from the swap space to the RAM.
	
How much RAM is needed versus swap space?

	Red Hat's guide
		RAM = 2 GB -> Swap space = 2 * RAM
		
					If allowing hibernation:
					swap space = 3 * RAM
					
		RAM = 2 GB < x < 8 GB -> swap space = RAM
						hibernation:
							swap space = 2 * RAM
		
		etcâ€¦
		
What is Hibernation?

	When powering off a system, hibernation allows all the memory from RAM to be stored in swap space. Then, the system does not need to fully boot. It will needs to restore the RAM content.
	
	So, if using hibernation, swap space must be > RAM space
