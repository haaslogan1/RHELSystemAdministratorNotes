How do I make a device automatically mounted after re-booting?

	Modify the /etc/fstab file to include the mounted device
	
	Example entry in this file:
		UUID=â€¦ [mount point] [file system type] [comma-seperated list of options] [used by dump command to back up the device] [whether fsck should run - dependent on file system type]
		
		
	Reload the daemons after:
		systemctl daemon-reload
		
Important: use UUIDs to distinguish between block devices. Block device names are subject to change. UUIDs never change.
