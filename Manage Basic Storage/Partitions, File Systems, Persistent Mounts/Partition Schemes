Tell me about the scheme used for Basic Intput/Output System's firmware (small memory chip): MBR (Master Boot Record)

	Up to 4 primary partitions
	With 32-bit partition sice, MBR allows a size up to 2 tebibytes (TiB)
	
	2 TiB is a limitation making this partition scheme outdated
	
Today's partition scheme: GPT (GUID Partition Table)
	
	Used for system's running UEFI (unified extensib;e firmware interface)
	
	Max: 128 partitions
	Allocates 64 bits for logical block addressed
		This support up to 8 billion TiB (or 8 zebibytes (ZiB))
		
	Other benefits over MBR:
		GUID - globally unique identifier
		Redundancy - primary GPT at fromt and backup GPT at the end
		Uses checksum to detect error
