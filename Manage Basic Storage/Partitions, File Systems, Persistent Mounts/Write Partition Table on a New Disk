How do I write a partition table on a new disk?

	1) Write a disk label: tells OS which partition scheme to use
		parted /dev/vdb mklabel msdos
		
		parted /dev/vbd mklabel gpt
		
		
		WARNING: running this command on an existing drive wipes all data
		
	2) Use the interactive parted tool to actually make the partition
		
		Steps will vary whether you make a GPT or MBR partition
		
		Non-interactive GPT example
			parted /dev/vdb mkpart userdata xfs 2048s 1000MB
			
		Non-interactive MBR example
		
			parted /dev/vdb mkpart primary xfs 2048s 1000MB
		
	3) Run:
		
		udevam settle
		
		This command waits for the system to notice the new partition and make a new device file in the /dev directory
		
		
How do I delete partitions?

	
	1) Run: 
		parted [device name] print
		
	2) Find the partition number that you want to delete
	3) Run:
		
		parted [device name] rm [number from (2)]
