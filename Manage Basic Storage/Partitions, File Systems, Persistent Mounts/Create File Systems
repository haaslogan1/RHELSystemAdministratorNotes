Are there any pre-requisites to creating a file system?

	Yes! Make the block device first.
	
How do I "create a file system?"

	"Create file system" = apply a file system to a block device
	
	To apply a XFS filesystem for the block device at /dev/vdb1, run:
		mkfs.xfs /dev/vdb1
		
	To apply a ext4 file system for the block device at /dev/vdb1, run:
		mkfs.ext4 /dev/vdb1
