Why would I want partitioned disks?

	Easy!
		a. Limit storage availability for users
		b. Sperate OS and program files from user files
		c. Memory swapping
			i. Memory stored in RAM can be moved when there is more demand for memory than the computer has available
		d. Limit disk space usage
			i. This helps with performance of diag tools and taking bakups
